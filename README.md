### NTHU 113 10 CS 542200 Parallel Programming

### Introduction

- In this course, I have learned to perform parallel optimization of `CPU` programs using `MPI` and `OpenMP`, gaining a solid understanding of fundamental parallel optimization techniques and concepts. 
- Later, I advanced to mastering `GPU` program optimization with `CUDA`, exploring various `CUDA` parallel optimization methods to ensure my programs achieve the best possible performance.
- You can find the details of Labs and Hws in the following directories.
